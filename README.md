- ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, I'm Shreyaan, a 16-year-old student inÂ high school. I enjoy working on projects that use different programming languages, such Python, Rust, and Front-End Languages, because I have a strong interest in coding. My love of technology motivates me to keep learning new things and honing my craft. My efforts are an attempt to find new ways to solve problems and develop useful applications. I'm committed to learning more and giving back to the tech industry. Currently im trying different things such as kali linux networking, School competions and well i forgot the others. Feel Free to see my projects.
